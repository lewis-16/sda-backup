## Usage

For each of the training scripts (`run_<model>_decoder.py`), first specify the configuration at the beginning of the script, and then run the script as follows:
```bash
python run_<model>_decoder.py
```

The training script will (by default) save the trained model and its checkpoints. To evaluate and compare multiple trained models, you can use the `run_comparison.py` script:
```bash
python run_comparison.py
```
In this file, you need to specify the paths to the trained models you want to compare, as well as the dataset and other parameters (see configuration at the top of the script).
